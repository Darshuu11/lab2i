Configure Slack as a communication channel and integrate it with Jenkins.

🎯 What are we doing in this experiment?

In this experiment, you will:

Install and set up Slack

Create a workspace in Slack

Create a channel (example: #jenkins-alerts)

Install the Slack app in Jenkins

Generate a Slack Webhook / Token

Configure Jenkins to send build notifications to Slack

This is used in CI/CD pipelines so your team receives a message when:

Build succeeds

Build fails

Build starts

Build finishes

🎯 What are we expecting to learn?

You will learn:

How Slack is used for DevOps communication

How Jenkins sends automated notifications

How Webhooks and tokens connect Slack ↔ Jenkins

How to trigger a message in Slack when Jenkins executes a job

After completing C2, your Jenkins pipeline can automatically message your Slack channel like:

“Build SUCCESS: Job #21 finished at 3:45 PM 🎉”

🧪 Steps in C2 (as per your PDF)
1. Install Slack

Download Slack desktop/app

Create a Slack account

2. Create Workspace

Example:
vvce-devops-lab

3. Create a Slack Channel

Example:
#jenkins-notifications

4. Add Slack App Integration

Go to Slack Apps → Search “Jenkins CI”

Add it to your workspace

Generate:
✔ Integration Token
✔ Webhook URL

5. Add Plugin in Jenkins

In Jenkins:

Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available Plugins → Slack Notification


Install it.

6. Configure Slack in Jenkins
Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Slack


Paste:

Workspace

Token Credential ID

Test Connection → Should say:
“Successful!”

7. Add Slack Notification to a Job

Inside your Jenkins job:

Post-build actions → Slack Notifications


Choose:

Notify on Success

Notify on Failure

Notify on Every Build

Run the job → Slack will show a message.

📌 Final Output of C2

Your Slack channel will receive automated messages from Jenkins like:

Build #3 SUCCESS
Job: DevOps-MavenProject
Time: 4:22 PM
Triggered by: SCM change
